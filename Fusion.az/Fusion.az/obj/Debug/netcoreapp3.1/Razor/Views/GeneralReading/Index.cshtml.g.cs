                <h3>An unusual job!</h3>
                Have you seen a football match recently? If you have,
                I╆m sure that you heard lots of comments about the
                referee as well as about the players! Referees have a
                very difficult job. They have to make quick and
                important decisions in the middle of a fast-moving
                game. And, of course, there are thousands of people
                shouting at them too. The crowd is never happy when
                the ref sends off their favourite player. Also, in football
                today t");
            WriteLiteral(@"here still isn╆t the same technology as there is in
                other sports, like tennis. The job can get even more
                difficult when you╆re a woman who is refereeing a
                men╆s match┿
                There is no reason why there should not be the same
                number of male and female referees in the sport today.
                However, the number of female refs is still very low ‒
                particularly at the highest levels of professional
                football. This is something that one woman, Pat Dunn,
                who died in 1999, would have been very sad about.
                Pat was the first woman in the UK to referee a men╆s
                football match but she wasn╆t allowed to do this for a
                long time┻ Pat was a strong supporter of women╆s
                rights in sport and became President of the Ladies╆
                Football Association in 1969. Then she decided to train
                to be a referee. Fo");
            WriteLiteral(@"r a long time the Football Association
                refused to give her a certificate although she had
                passed the exams. But Pat continued fighting and she
                finally got permission in 1976. The next month she
                became famous when she refereed her first official FA
                game. Pat became a very good and successful referee
                and even saved a footballer╆s life. She helped him when
                he was injured during a match!
                Today there are some famous female referees, like
                Bibiana Steinhaus from Germany who has just
                refereed the final of the Women╆s Football World Cup┻
                Bibiana decided to become a referee at the age of 16
                and later was the first female referee in the German
                men╆s professional league┻ But there are only a few like
                her.
                Football is still mainly a men╆s game ‒ both for players
